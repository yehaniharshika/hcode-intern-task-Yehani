# ðŸš— VehiCore - Comprehensive Vehicle Data Management System

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description

**VehiCore**  is a full-stack microservice-based web application designed for managing vehicle data efficiently. Built for the Hcode internship task, it enables importing vehicle records from CSV/Excel, real-time export handling, search with filters, and displays alerts using WebSockets. This system supports bulk operations via background job processing and is containerized for scalable deployment.
